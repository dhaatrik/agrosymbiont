## 2024-03-12 - [React Re-renders on Scroll]
**Learning:** Attaching a window 'scroll' event listener that triggers a React state update (e.g., `setScrollY`) at the root `Layout` component level is a severe performance bottleneck. It causes the entire application tree to re-render synchronously on every scroll tick, causing noticeable jank.
**Action:** Always prefer off-main-thread or composition-level solutions for scroll animations. Use Framer Motion's `useScroll` and `useTransform` to bind scroll progress directly to a `<motion.div>`'s style, bypassing the React render cycle entirely.
